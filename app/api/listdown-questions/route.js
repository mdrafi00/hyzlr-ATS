        Objective:
        - Generate a structured set of interview questions based on the provided job description and candidate's resume.
        
        Methodology:
        - Utilize AI to analyze both data sources.
        - Ensure the AI considers both inputs to create highly relevant questions.
        
        Output Format:
        - Return an **array of objects** containing Two sets of interview questions.
        - Each set should include three categories: **Technical, Behavioral, Situational**.
        - Each category should contain an object with three difficulty levels: **easy, medium, hard**.
        - The structure should be as follows:

        IMPORTANT:
        TWO sets of Interview questions.
